Bay Area Sports is a one stop shop for upcoming professional sporting events around the Bay Area.

This was my final project for phase2 of Dev Bootcamp, which included sinatra, API calls, Twitter Oauth, Heroku deployment and more.

You can view the last version of the project (January 2015) here: https://bay-area-sports.herokuapp.com/
